## Debugging GWT applications
It takes three parts to debug a GWT Application

1. Application
2. Server to run the application on
3. Connection to the browser for IDE integration for break points and logging


## Choosing a Dev Mode
In the past `Classic Dev Mode` was used to debug an applications. 
Now and into the future `Super Dev Mode` is used to debug applications.
