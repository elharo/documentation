# GWT Development Mode with the Tomcat Web Server
This covers running `GWT Development Mode` with the CodeServer entrypoint (a.k.a Super Dev Mode).

* The difference between this launcher and the others is it does not run a web server.
A web server has to be used when dubgging on the browser.  


## Archetype Used

* [Modular WebApp Archetype was used for this Demo](https://github.com/tbroyer/gwt-maven-archetypes)
